      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The possibilites of creating attractive, functional, and easy-to-navigate websites are what motivate me as a software developer. Everyday I strive to build products that even the tech-averse can use with confidence.</p>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I taught elementary music for 17 years in North Carolina. From peaceful, private piano lessons to louder, raucous classrooms bustling with children, my career was dedicated to music education. I have always been detail-oriented and also enjoy expressing my creative side in the following ways:
        <ol>
          <!--I did prioritize my hobbies-->
          <li>Reading (which fuels my ideas when writing) and Writing</li>
          <li>Singing</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Painting</li>
        </ol>
      <p>I learned that I could put these skills to use once I started learning the basics of coding.</p>
      <p>I am also a weightlifter who practices perseverance and hard work in the gym. I enjoy working out and pushing myself daily. This mindset directly affects my work ethic; especially as a new software developer. Currently an engineering student at Thinkful/Chegg Skills, my learning experience has affirmed my decision of being a software engineer.</p>
